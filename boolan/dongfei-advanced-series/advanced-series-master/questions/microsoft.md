Microsoft Interview Questions: Software Development Engineer (SDE)




   * You’re given an array containing both positive and negative integers and required to find the sub-array with the largest sum (O(N) a la KBL). Write a routine in C for the above.
   * Given an array of size N in which every number is between 1 and N, determine if there are any duplicates in it. You are allowed to destroy the array if you like. [ I ended up giving about 4 or 5 different solutions for this, each supposedly better than the others ].
   * Write a routine to draw a circle (x ** 2 + y ** 2 = r ** 2) without making use of any floating point computations at all.
   * Given only putchar (no sprintf, itoa, etc.) write a routine putlong that prints out an unsigned long in decimal.
   * Give a one-line C expression to test whether a number is a power of 2. No loops allowed.
   * Given an array of characters which form a sentence of words, give an efficient algorithm to reverse the order of the words (not characters) in it.
   * Give a good method to count the number of ones in a “n” (e.g. 32) bit number.
   * What are the different ways to implement a condition where the value of x can be either a 0 or a 1?
   * Reverse a linked list.
   * Insert in a sorted list.

   * How would you deal with a bug that no one wants to fix? Both the SDE and his lead have said they won’t fix it.
   * Write a function that counts the number of primes in the range [1-N]. Write the test cases for this function.
   * Given a MAKEFILE, design the data structure that a parser would create and then write code that iterates over that data structure executing commands if needed.
   * Write a function that inserts an integer into a linked list in ascending order. Write the test cases for this function.
   * Test the save dialog in Notepad.
   * Write the InStr function. Write the test cases for this function.
   * Write a function that will return the number of days in a month (no using System.DateTime).
   * You have 3 jars. Each jar has a label on it: white, black, or white&black. You have 3 sets of marbles: white, black, and white&black. One set is stored in one jar. The labels on the jars are guaranteed to be incorrect (i.e. white will not contain white). Which jar would you choose from to give you the best chances of identifying the which set of marbles in is in which jar.
   * Write the test cases for a vending machine.

   * A band is going in the street with a constant speed. Someone in the last row has a dog. The dog runs ahead, reaches the front row of the band and gets back to it’s owner. The dog’s speed was constant all the way and while it was running the band passed 50 feet. Find the length of the dog’s path,if the distance between the front and the rear row of the band is 50 feet.
   * The government wants cars to keep track of whether or not they are speeding. The part to determine this is already able to determine the speed of the vehicle, how would you design the rest of the system.
   * How many times a day do the hands on a clock overlap themselves?
   * You have 8 balls. One of them is defective and weighs less than others. You have a balance to measure balls against each other. In 2 weighings, how do you find the defective one?
   * There are 3 baskets. one of them have apples, one has oranges only and the other has mixture of apples and oranges. The labels on their baskets always lie. (i.e. if the label says oranges, you are sure that it doesn’t have oranges only,it could be a mixture) The task is to pick one basket and pick only one fruit from it and then correctly label all the three baskets.
